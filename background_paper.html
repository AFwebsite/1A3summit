        <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
        <p>The evolving Air Force environment has set the requirement for compound solutions to achieve lasting and durable
          successes for the 1A3 AFSC. Over the last 10 years, we have seen several AFSC mergers into the 1A3 community
          that have created complexity across different mission sets, coupled with geographical and communication barriers
          forcing leaders to formulate decisions within a narrowing scope. This diversity in mission, geography and a lack of
          exposure to the various missions within our community have reduced Senior Leaders’ collective ability to see and
          approach what are so often shared enterprise-wide challenges. The limited vantage points within MAJCOMs and
          MDS’s reduce our ability to address issues from a strategic level, without a collective voice, resulting in 1A3 talent
          management, CFETP evolution, and functional AFSC road mapping challenges. If we fail to unify we lose the
          ability to collectively steer decisions, formulate overarching AFSC strategies, and synchronize efforts. When
          combined, these generate increased risks that compound and lead to unintended or uncontrolled career field-wide</p><div class="w3-content w3-justify w3-text-grey w3-padding-64" id="about">
            <h2 class="w3-text-light-grey">Discussion</h2>
            <hr style="width:200px" class="w3-opacity">
            <p>To overcome such challenges and to take advantage of the 1A3 AFSC’s unique diversity as an enterprise, we
              recommend the normalization of a 1A3 Senior Leadership Conference to widen our network and discuss community
              wide initiatives and solutions. We must ask what type of experiences, education and training the Air Force and
              nation require to secure a strategic, operational and intellectual overmatch through 2040 and against our near-peer
              competitors. This event offers a forum to usher in a network to reorient the 1A3 community for the next fight.</p><div class="w3-content w3-justify w3-text-grey w3-padding-64" id="about">
